# Mighty Mail

Mighty Mail is standalone version of the mailing system in the upcoming refurbished MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod. The mailing system has a versatile use, and deserves it's own mod. In this mod. you'll find a post box and mailboxes available in every wood type. A post box allows you to send mail to other players on your server. You can include items and an optional message which is sent in the form of a package to any mailbox placed in the world. It also works across dimensions. When you receive mail, you mailbox will appear with a little red flag. To customise your experience, there are config options to change the inventory size of the mailboxes and increase the maximum delivery queue limit.
